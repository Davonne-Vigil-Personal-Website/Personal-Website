# Personal-Website

Hi, my name is Davonne! Welcome to my Updated Personal Website! Explore my site to learn more about me and my coding experience. I have a landing page, as well as an About Me Page, a Portfolio Page, and a Contact Page. On my Portfolio Page , I have projects that I have done on my journey learning how to code. I have edited my website to have some flex containers, z-index, nth selectors, !important, and to be responsive on smaller screens such as mobile devices. I also have the link to my GitHub Repository with the projects I have done in the past. 

Thanks for visiting my site!
