# Have make website responsive when you resize the screen

Hi, my name is Davonne, welcome to my Personal Website! Explore my site to learn more about me and my coding experience. I have a landing page, as well as an About Me Page, a Portfolio Page, and a Contact Page. On my Portfolio Page , I have projects that I have done on my journey learning how to code. I also have the link to my Git Hub Repository with the projects. 

Thanks for visiting my site!
